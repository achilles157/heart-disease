# Machine Learning Heart Disease Predictions

## Overview

This project aims to predict heart disease using machine learning techniques, specifically employing Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and a Hybrid Machine Learning approach. The analysis utilizes the Heart Disease UCI dataset obtained from Kaggle, a comprehensive collection of attributes related to heart health.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of various features such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant parameters. The target variable is the presence or absence of heart disease. By exploring and analyzing this dataset, we seek to develop predictive models that can assist in identifying individuals at risk of heart disease.

## Methods

### 1. Random Forest

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes for classification problems. In this project, we implement Random Forest to leverage its ability to handle complex relationships within the data.

### 2. Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a widely used statistical method for binary classification. It models the probability of the event occurring as a logistic function. In this project, Logistic Regression is employed to analyze the relationships between various independent variables and the likelihood of heart disease.

### 3. Hybrid Machine Learning

The Hybrid Machine Learning approach combines the strengths of different algorithms to enhance predictive performance. In this project, a customized hybrid model is created to leverage the strengths of Random Forest and Logistic Regression, providing a more robust prediction mechanism.

## Usage

To run the code and reproduce the results:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/machine-learning-heart-disease-predictions.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts to execute the machine learning models and analyze the results.

## Results

The project aims to evaluate and compare the performance of Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and the Hybrid Machine Learning approach. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score will be utilized to assess the models' effectiveness in predicting heart disease.
